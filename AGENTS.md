# Contributor safety rules

1. Keep development and production in separate Apps Script projects, spreadsheets, and local clasp configurations; never test against production.
2. Keep runtime settings in Script Properties; never commit credentials, tokens, real resource IDs, `.clasp.json`, or environment-specific clasp configuration.
3. Require `ENVIRONMENT` and `BOUND_ENVIRONMENT` to match before accessing the configured database; never silently select another workbook.
4. Initialize only an explicitly identified empty workbook using `INITIALIZATION_SPREADSHEET_ID` and the required confirmation; never clear an existing workbook.
5. Treat spreadsheet data as independent of source code: code deployment is not data deployment, migration, backup, or restoration.
6. Preserve existing rows and headers; change schemas only through reviewed, versioned migrations with explicit migration-ID approval.
7. Create and verify a restricted Drive backup before migrating or performing another risky production operation; do not bypass backup failures.
8. Never automatically delete sheets, rows, user data, or backup files; do not implement destructive reset or unattended restore operations.
9. Validate inputs, relationships, dates, and state transitions; use stable IDs rather than row numbers as identities.
10. Use the application lock and bounded bulk reads/writes for shared mutations; do not assume triggers or concurrent users execute serially.
11. Keep email and Calendar disabled by default and dry-run enabled; require environment validation, recipient-domain restrictions, and a per-run email cap before external sends.
12. Require explicit approval of the current task assignment version before assignment notifications; changing an assignee must invalidate stale approval.
13. Make automation retry-aware, keep audit/delivery records, and document uncertain external outcomes; never promise exactly-once delivery.
14. Run existing targeted tests and validation, use mocks locally, and verify authorization and Workspace behavior manually in development before production activation.
15. Update operating documentation for behavior changes, preserve manual recovery procedures, and state limitations honestly; never fabricate prototype evidence, benchmarks, or live verification.
